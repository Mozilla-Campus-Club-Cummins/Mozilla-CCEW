                    Nowthat we’ve looked at what open source is and why one should contribute, let’s look

                    the globe is eligible to contribute as well as put forth the projects to get their issues

                    a software tester, help with documentation and also provide innovative solutions to the

                <p>
                    This blog will primarily focus on participating as a contributor and helping first-timers
                    navigate their way through Hacktoberfest. <br><br>
                    As abeginner, “Hacktoberfest” may seem a bit overwhelming at first, but don’t let that
                    feeling get to you! Any person with a basic experience of working on GitLab/Github and
                    a determination to contribute can be a part of this celebration. It provides equal
                    opportunity for every participant, challenging them to put their abilities and skills to the
                    test. Hacktoberfest has also provided many resources and guides to help the
                    participants every step of the way on their <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">official website.</a> <br><br>
                    Once you go onGitHub or GitLab and search for "Hacktoberfest" you will find different
                    repositories to contribute to. The details of the project will be described in detail in the
                    Readme. mdfile in the repository. Remember, only repositories with the topic
                    ‘Hacktoberfest’ or issues labeled under the same name are officially part of the event.
                    Make sure to register on the official Hacktoberfest website before contributing as only
                    the Pull requests of registered candidates for eligible issues will be considered valid. <br><br>
                    The PRs are assigned on a first come first serve basis. At a given point in time, one PR
                    is assigned to only one person. Hence you don’t have to worry about competition and
                    don’t need to work in haste. However, continued inactivity can result in the PR being
                    reassigned to someone else. A time period will be allotted to work on every PR with its
                    duration depending on the maintainer. You are required to have at least four of your PRs
                    merged into original projects to be able to earn swags and goodies. <br><br>
                    There are many open source events throughout the year but Hacktoberfest is a perfect
                    platform to start as a beginner. Participating will not only give you a unique open-source
                    experience but also help in your career and will surely be an impressive addition to your
                    resume! <br><br>
                    As said before, earning swags & goodies should not be the main purpose of
                    participating. Thus one should not make spammy pull requests. GitHub/GitLab and
                    DigitalOcean have developed mechanisms to detect such spammy PRs and it may lead
                    to getting banned from contributing to Hacktoberfest in extreme cases. As correctly
                    mentioned on the Hacktoberfest website “The quality of pull requests is paramount; The
                    quantity comes second”. The maintainers can also report a PR as spam. Hence it's also
                    expected from participants to take care of the code of conduct and cling to the
                    essential rules against online harassment and bullying. Hence one can ensure a
                    memorable experience not only for themselves but for their peers too.
